			<p> Odds are either one of our links is mis-behaving or your keyboard cunningly wanted to see if I had designed my <b>404 page</b>. Well I did! I always am prepared.
				If you wish to navigate to the works page, just hit the "Works" tab to go back or <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/index.html">click here.</a>

			</p>

			<p> Should you for some reason not be able to get back to my home page, you can always leave me a note through one of my social media outlets below. Sorry for the inconvenience, happy browsing.</p>
